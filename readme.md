## Local Storage Add-Remove

* A mini project for add/remove/update items into local storage.
* You input a text to display on DOM, which is also will be saved to the local storage. 
* You can click to  remove listed items.
* Added/removed items also added/removed from local storage too. (it took a while to figure it out how).
* When page refreshed, it recalls all items from localStorage and updates DOM.
