## Local Storage Add-Remove

* A mini project for add/remove/update items into local storage and dom.
* You input a text to display on DOM, which is also will be saved to the local storage. 
* You can click on listed items for remove them individually, or remove all with the button below. 
* Added/removed items also added/removed from local storage too. 
* When page refreshed, it recalls all items from localStorage and updates DOM.
